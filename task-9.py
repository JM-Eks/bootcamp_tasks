# You've been hired by a local meteorological office to analyze temperature data from the past month.

# Tasks:
# Create a function called temperatureStats that accepts a list of daily temperatures and returns the minimum, maximum, and average temperatures. âœ…
# Add a default parameter that lets the user choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit outputs. âœ…
# Create a function called temperatureSummary that uses your first function and returns a formatted string summary of the results. âœ…

# ðŸ’¡ I learnt how to import the statistics module for this.
