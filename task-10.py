# You're developing a recommendation system for an online store.

# Tasks:
# Create a function calculate_similarity that takes two product dictionaries and returns a similarity score based on their categories and price range.
# Create a function recommend_products that takes a list of all products, a target product, and an optional parameter for the number of recommendations (default 3).
# Use keyword arguments to allow filtering by price range, category, or rating.
